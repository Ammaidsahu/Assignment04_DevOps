This repository contains the work for Assignment 4 in the DevOps course. The assignment involves demonstrating DevOps principles by utilizing Terraform for provisioning AWS infrastructure, Docker for containerization, and Git for version control.
üìù Assignment Overview

The goal of this assignment was to:

    Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, which includes:
        VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
        Subnet
        Security Groups
        EC2 instance

    Set up Docker on the EC2 instance, and containerize an application.

    Use Git to track changes and version control the project.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    Terraform (v1.x)
    AWS (EC2, VPC, Subnets, Security Groups)
    Docker (v20.x)
    Git for version control
    GitHub for repository hosting

üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

Terraform was used to automate the creation of the following AWS resources:

    VPC:
        CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
        Name: devops-vpc

    Subnet:
        CIDR Block: 10.0.1.0/24
        Public IP on Launch: True
        Name: public-subnet

    Security Group:
        Inbound Rules:
            SSH (Port 22): Allow from any IP (0.0.0.0/0)
            HTTP (Port 80): Allow from any IP (0.0.0.0/0)
        Outbound Rule: Allow all traffic.

    EC2 Instance:
        AMI: Amazon Linux 2
        Instance Type: t2.micro
        User Data: Installs and starts Docker on launch.

üê≥ Docker Setup

The Dockerfile builds an image that does the following:

    Installs Docker on the EC2 instance.
    Starts the Docker service on boot.
    Adds the ec2-user to the Docker group to allow running Docker without sudo.
